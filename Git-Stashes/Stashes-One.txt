 THE STASHING CONCEPT

 The concept of stashing came into picture for a condition where suppose that me as a User is working
  on a branch, and for some reason he/she needs to switch the branch immeditely but dont want the changes 
  to come to the branch the user is switching. Thus git offers a concept of stashing.

  the command -> git stash
  This is the short command for -> 'git stash save'

  TO CHECK FOR THE STASHES ->  'git stash show'
  TO APPLY THE STASH -> 'git stash pop' 
  -> THIS POP WILL APPPLY THE STASH AND CLEAR FROM THE STASH LIST
  or 'git stash apply'
  -> THIS WILL JUST APPLY THE STASH BUT NOT POP THE STASH

  Now to remove the most recent stash -> 'git stash clear'


  AN IMPORTANT THING, WORKING WITH MULTIPLE STASHES
  Suppose that we have multiple stashes, and now what we want is we need to apply a specific stash,
  so for that first of all, we need to check the list. 
  The command is -> 'git stash list'

  This will give output like This:
  stash@{0}: WIP on rainbow: 2d9c584 Removed the background color
  stash@{1}: WIP on rainbow: 2d9c584 Removed the background color
  stash@{2}: WIP on rainbow: 2d9c584 Removed the background color

  Now whichever stash you want to apply, you can use the command ->
  git stash apply stash@{2} : 'git stash apply stash@{stashId}'


  DROPPING THE STASHES

    Dropping a particular stash -> 'git stash drop stash@{stashId}'
    drop all the stashes -> 'git stash clear'
