LETS TALK ABOUT MERGING BRANCHES
 Now the term merging means combining the 2 branches. 
 Now to do that, what we do is :
 1.) we move to the branch in which we want to merge,  
    e.g. we wanna merge 1 branch to master/main, we first switch to the master/main branch
 2.) we run the merge command to merge the code from 1 branch to master/main
    command -> git merge <branch_name>


   VISUALIZING MERGES
   we can use any GUI, like github desktop, or Gitkraken. 

   ********* AN IMPORTANT PART
   ********* MERGE CONFLICTS AND HOW TO RESOLVE THEM


   MERGE CONFLICTS ARISE WHEN THERE ARE 2 CHANGES IN THE SAME FILE, THEN GIT DOES NOT ABLE
   TO MERGE, THAT'S WHERE MERGE CONFLICT COME AND YOU HAVE TO RESOLVE THEM MANUALLY

There are a few things to have a look ->

>>>>>>>>>>>> branch-name

REMEMBER THAT THE CONTENT FROM THE BRANCH YOU ARE TRYING TO MERGE FROM IS DISPLAYED BETWEEN =========== AND >>>>>>>>>> SYMBOLS

The Green part means that what we have in the branch ourselves and the Blue part means what we are getting from the Incoming branch,
means when we try to merge or rebase
