Now There could be some cases where the user needs to make sure that some of the files should not be 
tracked by git, like the dependencies packages or such.

Now we can achieve this behaviour easily by using a .gitignore file at the root of all the 
files and simply add the files or directories(Folders) to make sure that these are not tracked by git.

For e.g. ->

Suppose there is a file that contains the details for the API KEYS That I dont want git to track,
so in the .gitignore file, we can add a file like this ->

API_KEYS.txt -> where API_KEYS is the file name
node_modules/ -> This is the directory that has got the dependencies which should not be tracked and much more.

Now there is a website you can use that helps to create the content for the project depending on the need
 and the type of project you are working on.
