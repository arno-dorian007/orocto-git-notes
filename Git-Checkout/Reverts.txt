GIT REVERT 

This is a similar command like reset, but there is a major difference between these 2.

NOW THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RESET AND REVERT IS :

Suppose if you have used the Reset command, and we have reset the hash 2 commits before, then those 2 commits
between will be lost, However with git revert, there is no such loss.
Instead, It will create a new commit ahead of the reverted commit
    Command -> ' git revert <commit_hash> '
Now if you fire this command and make the changes, it will first ask to add some additional commit
by opening VIM as default, where you can add a commit or the default will be the last commit.
and when you save there will be a new commit but old commit wont be gone, it will be there as well.

WHY DO WE DO THIS??
This is for the collaboration
