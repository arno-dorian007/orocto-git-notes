ls -> list
open . -> this opens an explorer window on a mac
start . -> this opens an explorer window on a windows PC
ls folderName -> This opens the list of all the elements in a folder
pwd -> this prints the path where you currently are, it means print working directory
cd directoryName -> This changes the directory, means moves from 1 folder to another
cd .. -> Move backwards from the current directory
touch fileName.fileExtension -> this will create a new file with the provided name and fileExtension
touch fileName1.fileExtension fileName2.fileExtension -> this will create 2 or how many files user wants to create.

TOUCH IS USED TO MAKE NEW FILES, How ABOUT NEW FOLDERS
TO MAKE A NEW FOLDER, DIRECTORY WE CALL IT,
mkdir directoryName -> To create a new directory/folder

NOW LETS TALK ABOUT DELETING THE FILES

rm fileName.fileExtension -> This will remove the files, this works relatively, means you need to reach to the 
    location to delete a file

    rm fileName.fileExtension -> e.g. rm TextNotes.TextNotes
    ALWAYS BE CAREFUL AS THIS REMOVES THE FILE PERMANENTLY.

    NOW LETS TALK ABOUT DELETING SOME FOLDERS
    rm folderName will not work as to delete the folders, to delete the folder we need a more variation
    rm -rf folderName
